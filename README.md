# Vue.js Example with Grunt and Browserify

This repository contains a sample Node.js application which mixes together a
few of my favorite Node front- and back-end tools. 

__Dramatis Personae__
* Vue.js
* Grunt
* Browserify
* Babel
* Pug
* Sass
* And much more!

## Running the project

Begin by installing dependencies with `npm` - should work on Node 6+.

```
npm install
```

If you don't have it already, install Grunt globally.

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Grunt tasks are pretty bare bones - I only composed the command you would use
to run the application in development mode. Run the app on
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with the `grunt` command.

```
grunt
```
